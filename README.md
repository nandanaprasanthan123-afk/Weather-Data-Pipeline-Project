Weather Data Pipeline Project
_______________________________

This project is a serverless weather data pipeline built using AWS services and Snowflake.

The pipeline collects real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API, processes it using AWS Lambda, stores it in DynamoDB and S3, and finally loads the data into Snowflake using Snowpipe for analytics and reporting.


Features
____________
1.Fully serverless architecture
2.Automated scheduled data collection
3.Real-time stream processing
4.Cloud storage integration
5.Auto-ingestion into Snowflake
6.Scalable and cost-effective pipeline


Workflow
_______________
1 OpenWeather API
    Fetches real-time weather data.

2 Amazon EventBridge
    Triggers the pipeline on a schedule.

3 AWS Lambda
    Calls the OpenWeather API.
    Processes and transforms the response.

4 Amazon DynamoDB
    Stores incoming weather records.

5 DynamoDB Streams
    Captures changes in DynamoDB.

6 AWS Lambda (Stream Processor)
    Reads stream events.
    Pushes processed data into Amazon S3.

7 Amazon S3
    Stores weather data files.

8 S3 Event Notification / SQS
    Detects new files uploaded to S3.

9 Snowpipe
    Automatically ingests files from S3.

10 Snowflake
     Stores and analyzes weather data.
